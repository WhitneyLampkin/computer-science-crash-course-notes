# Boolean Logic & Logic Gates

- Leaving simplicity of seeing every switch and gear to go up the layers of abstraction 
	- Allows assembling complex systems 
- Binary - of two states
	- Represents the 2 electronic switch states (on/off)
	- Uses 1 & 0 to represent on/off electric states
	- Tertiary and quinary computers were used but werenâ€™t as effective early on
- George Boole - Boolean Algebra (1800s)
	- NOT, AND, OR
	- Boolean logic can be built with transistors
	- Gates - control the path of circuits
		- NOT Gates (triangle with dot)
		- AND Gates (capital D)
		- OR Gates (spaceship)
		- XOR Gate (OR gate with a smile) - 1 true and 1 false
	- Most programmers use logic gates now
