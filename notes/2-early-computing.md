# Early Computing

## What is a computer?

-Computers are simple machines that perform complex logic through many layer of abstraction

## Early computing devices

- Abacus  - earliest recognized device for computing
    - Mesopotamia (2500 BC)
    - Hand operated calculated
    - Stored current state of computation
- Astrolabe - used by ships to calculate latitude at sea
- Slide Rule - multiplication and division tool
- Clocks - calculate sunrises, time, etc.

## Evolution of the "computer" term

- First documented use in 1613 in book by Richard Braithwait
    - "I have read the truest computer of times, and the best arithmetician that ever breathed, and he reduceth thy dayes into a short number."
- Used as a job title for people who performed calculations (sometimes with the help of machines)
- Late 1800s it was used to refer to devices
- Human calculators called computers until 1970s

## Step Reckoner 

- By German polymath Gottfried Leibniz
- Incremented by 1 using gears
- Also used for multiplication and division
- First machine that could add, subtract, multiple and divide
- Could take hours or days
- Not accessible to most of the population

## Precomputed tables

- Range tables - used for cannons in the war

## Charles Babbage

- Known as "the father of computing"
- Difference Engine - approximated polynomials relationship between several variables)
    - Charles Babbage
    - 1823 - 1843 worked on the project before it was abandoned
    - Finished in 1991 by historians
- Analytical Engine
    - Charles Babbage's idea for a general purpose computer
    - Used for more than 1 particular computation
    - Able to accept data and run operations in sequence
    - Had memory and a primitive printer
    - Ahead of its time so it was never fully constructed

## Ada Lovelace - English mathematician

- Wrote hypothetical programs for the Analytical Engine
- Considered the world's first programmer

## Herman Hollerith 

- His tabulating machine was invented to solve the U.S.'s problem with conducting census in the late 1800s
- Electro-mechanical
- Used punch cards to represent data
- 10x faster than manual tabulations
- Reduced census from 13 years to 2 years
- Founded the Tabulator Machine Company
    - Later became International Business Machine Corporation in 1924 after merging with other companies (IBM)
