# The First Programming Languages

- Machine Language or Machine Code - language computer processors natively speak
	- binary code
- In early programming, programs were 100% written in machine language 
- Pseudo code - high level explanation of program
- 1940s/50s higher level languages were being used
- Mnemonics were used for opcodes
- Assembler - reads assembly language and translates it to binary for the machine to process
	- Assembly Language- direct 1-1 mapping to Machine Instructions
- Grace Hopper
	- One of the 1st programmers on the Harvard Mack I computer
	- Created Arithmetic Language Version 0 or A-0
	- Built first compiler in 1952
	- Compiler - translates source code from a programming language to low level language (assembly or machine)
- Variables - abstractions for the memory locations needed
- Fortran (Formula Translation) by IBM 1957
	- John Backus - project director
- Committee on Data Systems Languages
	- Advisor - Grace Hopper
	- Formed to address the issue of having to rewrite programs for differentiation computers
	- Developed COBOL
	- COBOL - Common Business-Oriented Language
		- “Write once, run anywhere”
- 1960s Languages
	- ALGOL
	- LISP
	- BASIC
- 1970s Languages
	- Pascal, C and Smalltalk
- 1980s Languages
	- C++, Objective C, Perl
- 1990s Languages
	- Python, Ruby, Java
