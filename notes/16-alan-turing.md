# Alan Turing

- Father of computer science 
- Founded many of the concepts
- Decision Problem - is there an algorithm that takes a statement written in formal logic and produces “yes” or “no” that’s always accurate
	- 1935
	- As known as Entscheidung Problem
	- Alonzo Church (1935) - first solution
		- Used Lambda Calculus
		- Determine that it was impossible
	- Turing Machine - hypothetical computing machine Turing used to solve the Decision problem
		- Used simple, yet powerful mathematical model of computation
		- Used different mathematics but equivalent to lambda calculus in terms of power
		- Proved that the machine could perform any computation if given enough time and memory (like humans)
		- The first idea of a general purpose computer
- Turing Complete - any computer as powerful as the Turing Machine
	- All modern computers
- Halting Problem - is there is algorithm that will determine if a Turing Machine will run forever based on its inout and description of the machine?
	- Turing decided it was unsolvable
- Bizarro Machine
	- Proves that not all problems can be solved with computation even though the Turing machine could perform any computation it still could solve all problems
- Church-Turing Thesis
- PHD at Princeton 1936 - 1938
- Engima  machines - used to code German communication during WWII
	- Encryption- scrambling text using an algorithm 
	- Decryption- unscrambling text using an algorithm 
- The Bombe - electromechanical computer by Turing
- Turing also assisted with the Manchester Mach 1 after the war
- 1950 - Artificial Intelligence
	- Turing Test - AI convincing a human that it was human
	- CAPTCHA - Completely Automated Public Turing Test
- 1941 - Turing committed suicide at 41
- Turing Award - highest award in computer science
