# Intro to Algorithms

- Algorithm- specific steps used to compute a computation
	- Term came from Muhammad ibn Musa al-Khwarizmi - a father of algebra
- Complexity - relationship between inout size & number of steps an algorithm takes to run
	- Written in Big O Notation 
- Sorting Algorithms
	- Selection sort O(n^2)
	- Merge sort O(nlogn)
- Graph Search
	- Graph - network of nodes connected by lines
	- Brute Force Approach O(n!)
	- Dinkstraâ€™s algorithm O(n^2)
		- Edsger Dinkstra
		- Later improved to O(n log n + 1)
		- Used in Google maps
