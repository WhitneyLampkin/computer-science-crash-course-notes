# The Central Processing Unit (CPU)

- CPU - processor used to executes programs
- Microarchitecture - high level view of CPU
	- RAM - for this example we use 16 memory locations each having 8-bits
	- Four 8-bit Memory Registers (Registers A, B, C, D)
		- Used to temporarily store and manipulate values
		- Instruction Table - defines instructions supported by the CPU and their IDs
			- Stored in 8-bits
			- First four bits store the operation code
			- The second four bits store the address
	- Instruction Register – stores the 8-bit code for the instruction
	- Instruction Address Register
	- NOTE: All registers start with 0s when computer boots
- Phases of Computer Processing
	- Fetch Phase - first instruction 
		- 00000000 is sent from the Instruction Address Register to the RAM and returns the data at that address
		- The data returned from RAM is input into Instruction Register to be executed
	- Decode Phase - Opcode (first 4-bits from the instruction register) is used to run the corresponding instruction from the instruction table
	- Execute Phase - the RAM address from the instruction register is used to retrieve the value at that address in RAM and load it into Register A
	- Execution phase end when the value of the instruction register is incremented by 1
	- This full package is know as a control unit
- Control Unit - directs the different parts of the CPU like an orchestra director
	- An ALU is needed for any add instructions in the instructions table
- Clock - keeps everything in sync
	- Clock Speed - speed at which CPU carries out a fetch-decode-execute cycle (Hz)
- Intel 4004 - first, single-chip 4-bit CPU (1971)
	- 740 kHz = 740,000 cycles per second
	- Today’s electronics can perform billions of CPU cycles per second with a few GHz
- Overclocking CPUs - modifying CPU clock to speed up the tempo of cycles
	- Can lead to overheating or gobbledygook
- Under-clocking CPU - saves battery power
- Dynamic Frequency Scaling - how modern processors increase/decrease clock speed
- CPU chip 
	- Packages up everything mentioned before (except the RAM) into a new unit
- This CPU is a simplified one compared to modern processors
