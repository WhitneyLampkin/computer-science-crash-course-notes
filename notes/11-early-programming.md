# Early Programming

- How are programs loaded into computer memory?
- Programmable Textile Loom
	- Joseph Marie Jacquard
	- First programmable machine
- Control Panel - sockets used by programmers to plug in cables to pass values and signals into different parts of the machine
	- Also known as Plug Boards
- The Eniac also used plug boards
	- Could take up to 3 weeks to get the Eniac program to run
	- Weeks of downtime needed to switch programs
- 1940s/50s memory was smaller and cheaper allowing programmers to store programs in memory vs. on physical plug boards
	- Stored program conouters (?)
	- Von Newman Architecture (1948) - storing programming data in single shared memory
		- This is what was built in Lesson 8
		- Components
			- ALU
			- Data registers
			- Instruction register
			- Instruction address register
			- Memory storage for data and instructions
- Punch cards & punch card readers in most computers by 1980s
- US Air Force SAGE Air Defense System (1955) - largest program on punch cards (used over 62,500 ~ 5MB of data)
- Punch paper tape
	- Bugs were patched with literal patches of tape
- Panel programming
- Altair 8800 - first commercial home computer based on switches used to write the opcodes into memory (1975)
- A simply way to write programs was needed
