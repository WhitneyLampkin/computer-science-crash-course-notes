# Electronic Computing

- Harvard Mark I - one of the largest electromechanical computers
	- 1944 by IBM
	- Created for WWII allies
	- Ran simulations for the Manhattan Project
	- Electromechanical relays are like water faucets that control the flow of electrons instead of water
		- The relays had issues related to its mass and wear and tear
		- Relays had a lifespan of 10 years
	- Harvard Mark I relays had to be replaced daily
- [NOTE]: The term "bugs" in computing originated from a dead moth being pulled from a malfunctioning relay
- John Ambrose Fleming
	- Thermionic Valve - new electrical component that had airtight glass bulb
		- 1904
		- First vacuum tube - improvement over mechanical relays
	- Diode - electronical component that permits the 1-way flow of current
	- Switch - turns flow of current on and off
- Lee de Forest
	- 1906 - 3rd electrode: same as a relay but better
- Transition to electronic computers happened because of the rising costs of electromechanical computing 
	- Tommy Flowers - Colossus MK I (1943)
		- Decrypted Nazi communication
		- First programmable machine
	- Alan Turing - The Bombe 
		- Break Nazi written code?
	- Electronic Numerical Integrator And Calculator (ENIAC) (1946)
		- University of Pennsylvania by J. Presper Eckert & John Mauchly
		- In service for 10 years
		- Said to have performed all of the calculations ever done my humans in history up to that point within those 10 years
	- By 1950 vacuum tube computing was reaching its limits
	- Transistor (1947)
		- Bell Laboratory Scientists
		- Used quantum mechanics
		- Connect 2 electrodes via a semiconductor that can either allow or resist the current
		- Solid state component
		- Led to smaller, cheaper computers
			- IBM 608 (1957)
		- This eventually led to transistor computers being small enough for offices and  homes
		- Today nanotechnology has allowed us to massively reduce the size of transistors and improve over computing speed
		- Silicon is used to create semiconductors 
		- William Shockley
			- Founded Shockley Semiconductor 
			- His employees founded Fairchild Semiconductor 
			- Their employees founded Intel
		- Intel - worlds largest computer chip maker
		- Transistors allow us to turn electricity off and on really quickly (1 million times per second per transistor)
