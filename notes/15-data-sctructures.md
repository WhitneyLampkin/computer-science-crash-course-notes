# Data Structures

- Data structures - used to organize data in memory
- Array - a series of values stored in memory
	- Index
	- Each value of an array is stored in its own memory location
	- Must be stored in order in memory
		- Difficult to add new values in the middle
- Strings - arrays of characters
	- Null Character - End with a 0 in memory (binary not character 0)
	- Stored the same as an array
	- String concatenation functions - add strings together
	- Used to build more complicated data structures without the limitations of arrays which are not good for inserts and deletes
- Types of Structs
	- Node - struct that stores the value and a pointer
		- Pointer - knows the memory address of the next items value
		- Used to create linked lists
- Linked List 
	- Circular
	- Terminated with NULL (binary 0)
	- Easier to insert/delete items by changing pointer to the next item
- Matrix - array of arrays
	- Five dimensional Array
- Struct - groups of data bundled together in memory (compound data structures)
- Queue
	- FIFO - first in, first out
- Stack
	- LIFO - last in, first out
	- Data is pushed on and popped off stacks
- Trees
	- Struct with 2 pointers
	- Root - node at the first top
	- Children nodes - other nodes
	- Parent nodes - nodes above children
	- Leaf nodes - nodes at the bottom with no children
	- Binary tree - each parent only has 2 children nodes
- Graphs
	- Nodes with many pointers
- Red-Black Trees & Heaps
