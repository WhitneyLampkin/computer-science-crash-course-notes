# Registers and RAM

- Random Access Memory (RAM) - stores active in-use memory as long as the power stays on
	- Short term or working memory
	- Keeps track of whatâ€™s happening now
	- Larger chunks of memory than registers
- Types of RAM
	- SRAM - Static Random Access Memory (uses latches)
	- DRAM
	- Flash Memory
	- NVRAM
- Persistent Memory - can survive without power
- Building a circuit that stores 1-bit of information
		- OR gate - circuit that records 1
		- AND gate - circuit that records 0
	- AND-OR LATCH
		- Takes 2 inputs (SET and RESET)
		- SET input -sets output to 1
		- RESET input - sets output to 0
		- If SET and RESET both equal 0 then the circuit outputs the LAST output ==> MEMORY!
		- Latch is used because it "latches onto" a value and stays that way
	- GATED LATCH
		- Data Input - 1-bit that represents the SET and RESET values
		- Write enable - 1-bit that determines if the data can be changed by opening or closing the circuit
- Register - small, linear chunks of memory used to store a single value
	- group of latches that hold a single number
	- Width - number of bits in a register
- 16x16 LATCH MATRIX
	- Latches arranged in a grid instead of a row
	- 16x16 latch matrix used for 256 bits
	- Turning the "wires" for both the row and column to 1 of a latch activates it
	- To enable writing, the row/column wires and the write enable wire must be turned on
- Memory Address
	- Defines the intersection for the row & column of a latch matrix
	- In a 16x16 matrix, 4-bit numbers are used for rows and columns to allow us to represent 0-16
	- The full latch address is 8-bit with the row written first then column [RRRRCCCC]
	- Latch at row - 12 & column 8 is 11001000
- Multiplexers - used to select the cols and rows in matrixes from the 4-bit inputs that make up the 8-bit address
- Small packages of memory are repackaged over and over again to get our larger, more powerful computers
