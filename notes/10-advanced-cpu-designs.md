# Advanced CPU Designs

- Modern processors have additional, complex circuits for more specific processing
- As CPU processing speed increase, RAM becomes a bottleneck 
	- The hold up is with getting data in and out of RAM
- BUS - wire that sends data between CPU & RAM
- Improving performance by improving processing of a single instruction 
	- Cache - small RAM placed in the CPU to address the RAM bottleneck issue
		- Stores a section of RAM for faster processing so electrons don’t have to flow through RAM and back to CPU again
	- RAM - usually GBs
	- Cache - usually MBs
	- Cache Hit - when data is quickly retrieved from the cache instead of RAM
	- Cache Miss - retrieving data from RAM when it’s not found in the Cache
	- Dirty Bit - flag that represents whether or not cache data is synced with RAM
	- Parallelized operations - uses batches to improve throughput 
	- Out of Order Execution
	- Pipelining
	- Conditional Jump Instructions 
	- Speculative Execution 
	- Pipeline Flush
	- Branch
	- Branch Predictions
	- Superscaler
	- Using multiple ALU allows for parallel processing of mathematical operations
- Improving performance by running multiple instructions at a time
	- Multi-core processors - increase computer performance by running several instructions at one time
	- Dual-core
	- Quad-core
	- Multiple CPUs
	- Super computers 
		- Sunway Taihulight (China)
		- Largest computer
		- 40,960 CPUs
			- Each with 256 cores
		- 10,000 cores total
- Flops
