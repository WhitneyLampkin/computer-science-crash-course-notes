# Integrated Circuits & Moore's Law

- Discrete Components- how computers were initially build from individual parts and wired together
- Tyranny of Numbers
- 1950s - transistors began to replace vacuum tubes in computers
- 1959 - IBM upgraded vacuum-tube-based “709” computers to transistors in I M 1790
- 1958 - Jack Kilby at Texas Instruments
	- Integrated electronic components 
	- Integrated Circuits (IC)
		- “Legos for computer engineers”
	- Used Germanium
- 1959 - Fairchild Semiconductor made ICs practical
	- Led by Robert Noyce
	- Used Silicon
- Printed Circuit Boards (PCBs) - connect ICs with metal wires that are etched into them
- Photolithography - uses light to transfer complex patterns to a material (like semiconductors)
- Wafer - thin slice of silicon
- How semiconductors are made
	- Silicon wafer
		- A single wafer creates dozens of ICs that are later cut into microchips
	- Oxide layer coating
	- Photoresist layer
	- Photomask
	- Acids - washes away unwanted photoresist 
	- Doping with different gases
	- Channels
	- Bipolar Junction Transistor
- 1950s - ICs had 5 transistors
- 1960s - ICs had over 100
- 1965 - Gordan Moore: every 2 years 2x transistors can fir unto chips (Moore’s Law)
- 1968 - Robert Noyce & Gordan Moore founded Intel (Integrated Electronics)
- Microprocessor - processors that are integrated circuits (ICs)
- COU transistor count in 1 IC  over the years
	- 1980s - 30,000
	- 1990s - 1 million
	- 2000s - 30 million
	- 2010 - 1 Billion
- VLSI (Very Large Scale Integrated) software (1979s) used to automatically generate chip designs
- Logic Synthesis
- The end of Moore’s Law
	- Size limits of the photomask
	- Quantum tunneling - electrons jump the gaps causing circuit leaks
